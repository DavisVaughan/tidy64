casting to double is an error if it might lose precision
========================================================

> x1 <- as_tidy64(tidy64_global_max_lossless_double_plus_one_chr)
> x10 <- rep(x1, 10)
> vec_cast(x1, double())
Error: Can't convert <tidy64> to <double>.
i Precision may be lost at location 1.

> vec_cast(x10, double())
Error: Can't convert <tidy64> to <double>.
i Precision may be lost at locations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

> vec_cast(x1, double(), x_arg = "x", to_arg = "to")
Error: Can't convert `x` <tidy64> to match type of `to` <double>.
i Precision may be lost at location 1.


casting to tidy64 from double is an error if OOB
================================================

> x1 <- .Machine$double.xmax
> x10 <- rep(x1, 10)
> vec_cast(x1, new_tidy64())
Error: Can't convert <double> to <tidy64>.
i Input is outside the range of a tidy64.
i Range was exceeded at location 1.

> vec_cast(x10, new_tidy64())
Error: Can't convert <double> to <tidy64>.
i Input is outside the range of a tidy64.
i Range was exceeded at locations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...

> vec_cast(x1, new_tidy64(), x_arg = "x", to_arg = "to")
Error: Can't convert `x` <double> to match type of `to` <tidy64>.
